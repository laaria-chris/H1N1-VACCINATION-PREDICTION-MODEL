 H1N1 FLU VACCINATION PREDICTION: A Machine Learning Project
## Project Overview

The aim of this study is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 flu vaccine. We believe the prediction outputs (model and analysis) of this study will give public health professionals and policy makers, as an end user, a clear understanding of factors associated with low vaccination rates. This in turn, enables end users to systematically act on those features hindering people to get vaccinated.

In this project, we used the survey data from the National Flu Survey (NHFS, 2009) to predict whether or not respondents got the H1N1 vaccine. It is important to understand past vaccination patterns in order to understand those of more recent pandemics, such as COVID-19. The most influential factors determining vaccination status are found to be:-
1. Doctor Recommendation of H1N1 vaccine
2. Health Insurance, 
3. Opinion of H1N1 Vaccine Effectiveness
4. Opinion of H1N1 Risk by our final model.

 We used six machine learning models to make the predictions. We used:-
 1. Decision Tree Classifier.
 2. Logistic Regression.
 3. Random Forest.
 4. K-Nearest Neighborhood Classifier.
 5. Gradient Boosting Classifier. 
 6. XG Boosting Classifier. 

The Gradient Boosting Classifier yielded the best accuracy and precision score.

So as to classify exactly those who got H1N1 flu shot from those that did not, we need a higher accuracy of the model outputs, as well as a high precision score, which is related to a low false positive rate (those who predicted to be vaccinated but did actually not get H1N1 flu shot).
